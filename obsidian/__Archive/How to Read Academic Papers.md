# Define Why You are Reading the Paper

Why are you reading the paper?
* Are you trying to get the current state of knowledge?
* Are you trying to get information to back up a specific point you are making as you are writing?
* Are you doing a systematic literature review and you are having to extract key information from it?
* Are you trying to do a critique?
* Are you trying to find more references?

Defining why you are reading the paper will shape the type of reading you will do.

# Triple Pass Method

## First Pass: Bird's Eye Method (Helicopter View)

Read the title and abstract.  Scan through the rest of the paper.  Ask yourself if this is something you want to go forward with?  Is it something that you actually need to read to fulfill your purpose?

When novice's read, they tend to gather verbatim details from the papers, whereas when experts read, they tend to gather the gist of the paper (i.e., the core concept of the paper).  It is not as crisp as the verbatim details, but it is usually easier to remember.

Read the paper to get the gist.  Determine if this paper is relevant for your why?  What is the paper about?  Is this paper something you want to go further with?

## Second Pass: The Swoop Method (Hawk Swoops in to Grab Mouse)

Swoop in to figure out:
* What is the debate?
* What are the main research questions?
* What methods did they use?
* What did they find?
* What are the main conclusions?

If you are swooping, get the core details that you need for your purpose.

>The swoop method should only take 3-5 minutes.

The swoop method will answer 97% of the why's you need for reading a particular article.

# Third Pass: Street Level Method (Take a Look Around)

There are some cases where you will need to read the full paper.  At this point, you will want to print the paper out and make a physical copy (potentially to highlight or mark up).  This is where you will go deep with a paper.  

This is when you go into a paper to reconstruct what the authors did to get a deep knowledge of their methods and their findings, in order to critique it.  This is also done to extract detailed information that you couldn't find in the swoop method alone.

Even when reading a paper to critique it, you should not the paper from cover to cover.  You can read it from the inside out, starting with the methods, the results, and reconstruct what the authors did and what they found before going into more detail, reading the conclusion and introduction.

## Other Advice

* Not all papers are written well.  Go easy on yourself, don't feel dumb and fall into imposter syndrome.  
* Take notice when the writing is good (i.e., this is a paper you want to emulate).  Being good at reading is being good at writing, in disguise.
* Practice makes perfect.
* Sometimes you may need to take a break.  Come to it the next day or at a later point.
* Rubber Duck Method: Talk aloud and speak/explain it to the rubber duck. Use this as a model for when you write, making it so easy and simple that even your grandma can understand.  Remove the jargon.
