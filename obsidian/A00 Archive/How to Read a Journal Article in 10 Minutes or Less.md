# Why are Journal Articles So Hard to Read

* You shouldn't be reading them.  They are not intended to be read cover to cover.  These articles are reports, divided into sections.  Some of these sections are relevant to you, a student researcher, and some are not.  Your goal is to read and take notes on the sections relevant to you.
* They are a specialized form of writing.  They require training to get the most out of them.

# How is a Journal Article Structured

## Title

Journal article titles are long.  They are required to tell the reader what is being done, why it is being done, how it is being done and to whom it is being done.  Consider journal article titles as a one-sentence summary of the article.

The average length in academic journals is 19 words, to be broken into parts.  Taken together, those parts provide a picture of what is in the article.

You can often decide to include or exclude an article in your reading based on how the title is broken down.

### Examples

A randomized controlled trial (what) || to improve social skills (purpose) || in young adults (in whom) || with Autism Spectrum Disorder (not just any young adults)

Designing for Climate Resilience: (a colon separates a subtitle from a main title) || What is the Influence of Environmental Conditions (what: effects of environmental conditions) || on thermal sensation (effects on what) || in subtropical high density cities (where).
## Abstract

The abstract distills the entire article for you.  The abstract is a miniature version of the entire article, without the details.  The abstract has the same exact parts as the main article: background, methods, results, and conclusions.  You can divide abstracts into those main four parts.
## Introduction

The introduction is broken into:
* What is known (literature review),
* What isn't known (research gap), and
* What research question will be answered.

If there is a hypothesis, it will usually be stated in the last paragraph or the last sentence of the introduction section.
## Methods

This section is usually the longest.  It is not usually intended for you, the student researcher.  It is usually intended for peer reviewers who will be evaluating the article for publication.  This section is also intended for other researchers who wish to evaluate or replicate the student themselves.  You, the student researcher, can usually skip the methods section.  
## Results

This section presents the data produced by the methods, presented without interpretation.  Skip this section.
## Conclusion

This section summarizes the study's significant findings and their implications.  This is an important section for you, the student researcher.  Here, you will want to stop, read for word for word, and take notes.

# Overall Reading Strategy

1. Understand the title.
2. Study the abstract to determine relevance/use.
3. If the article is relevant, the most direct route is to skip to the end for findings and conclusions.  If you need a deeper understanding or clarification of the topic or terms or concepts, all you have to do is circle back to the introduction (the literature review) and that will provide you with the understanding you need.
