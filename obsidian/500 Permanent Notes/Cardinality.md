>Cardinality refers to the number of elements in a set, indicating the set's size or length. For finite sets, it's a count of the distinct elements. For infinite sets, it describes the type of infinity (e.g., countable or uncountable).

>In mathematics, the concept of cardinality gives us a way to compare the sizes of sets, including those that are infinitely large. For finite sets, cardinality is straightforward—it's the count of unique elements within the set. However, when we delve into infinite sets, cardinality becomes a more nuanced concept.

>There are different "sizes" of infinity, and cardinality helps us distinguish between them. For example, the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ and the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ are both infinite, but the cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$ is strictly greater than the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$. This distinction is made possible through the concept of bijections—a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of two sets. If such a correspondence exists, the sets are said to have the same cardinality.

>The symbol used to represent the cardinality of a set $A$ is $|A|$. For example, if $A = {1, 2, 3}$, then $|A| = 3$.

>Infinite sets can be classified into two main types based on their cardinality: countably infinite sets, where the elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (e.g., the set of all integers $\mathbb{Z}$), and uncountably infinite sets, which cannot be matched with the natural numbers (e.g., the set of all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$).

>[!Examples]
>Finite Set: The set $A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}$ has a cardinality of 5, written as $|A| = 5$. Note that in set theory, each element is unique, and therefore it is considered only once when determining the cardinality of the set.
>
>Countably Infinite Set: The set of all natural numbers $\mathbb{N} = {1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ has a countably infinite cardinality.
>
>Uncountably Infinite Set: The set of all real numbers between 0 and 1 has an uncountably infinite cardinality.
