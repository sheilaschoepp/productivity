>Validation tasks are a set of tasks that are used to assess and fine-tune a machine learning algorithm.  These tasks are generally held-out from the set of training tasks and the set of testing tasks.  The performance of an algorithm on validation tasks may be used to tune the algorithm's hyperparameters or to change aspects of the training process (e.g., number of gradient steps).
