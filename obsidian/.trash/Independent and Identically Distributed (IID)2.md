## Independent and Identically Distributed (IID)

Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) is a concept used in statistics and probability theory to describe a set of random variables. When a set of variables is independent, it means that the value of one variable does not affect the value of another variable in the set. Identically distributed means that each variable in the set follows the same probability distribution.

### Example

Consider a situation where you repeatedly toss a fair coin and record the outcomes as either "Heads" (H) or "Tails" (T). Each coin toss can be treated as a random variable, and the sequence of coin tosses represents a set of random variables.
In this example, the coin tosses are independent because the outcome of one toss does not affect the outcome of subsequent tosses. The result of a particular toss, whether it is a Head or a Tail, does not provide any information about the outcome of the next toss.
Furthermore, the coin tosses are identically distributed because each toss follows the same probability distribution. In the case of a fair coin, the probability of getting Heads (H) is 0.5, and the probability of getting Tails (T) is also 0.5. These probabilities remain the same for each toss, resulting in an identical distribution for each random variable.
