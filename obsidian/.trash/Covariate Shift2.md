# Covariate Shift

Covariate shift, also known as input distribution shift, is a specific form of distribution shift that occurs when the distribution of input variables (covariates) changes between the training and testing phases of a machine learning model. In other words, it refers to a situation where the relationship between the input features and the target variable remains the same, but the distribution of the input features differs.

## Example

Consider an RL agent trained to navigate through a simulated maze environment to reach a target location. During the training phase, the agent explores various parts of the maze, encountering different types of obstacles, walls, and pathways. The distribution of states it observes during training reflects this exploration.

However, during the testing phase, the agent is evaluated on a different maze with a different layout or configuration. The new maze might have alternative routes, additional obstacles, or different spatial arrangements compared to the training maze. Consequently, the distribution of states encountered during testing is different from the training distribution.

This difference in state distribution between training and testing phases represents covariate shift. The agent may struggle to generalize its learned policy to the new maze because the state-action pairs it encounters during training are no longer representative of the testing environment.
