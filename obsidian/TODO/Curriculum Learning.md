>Curriculum learning is a training strategy in machine learning where models are gradually exposed to more complex training examples, typically starting with easier ones and progressively introducing harder ones, inspired by the idea of learning with a progressively challenging curriculum in human education. This approach is based on the belief that a model, like a student, may learn more effectively when knowledge is structured and gradually built up.
