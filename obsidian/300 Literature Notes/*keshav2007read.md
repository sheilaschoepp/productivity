# The Three-Pass Approach

This paper describes a three-pass approach to reading papers. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass.

## The First Pass

- This pass is to give you a bird's-eye view (general idea) of the paper. 
- This pass should take five to ten minutes.
- The first pass is adequate for papers that are not in your research area, but may someday prove relevant.

Steps
1. Carefully read the title, abstract and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
3. Read the conclusions.
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you have already read.

After, you should be able to answer the five C's:
- Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
- Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem (i.e., what established ideas, models, or theories from previous work were used to explain or interpret the data or situation being studied)?
- Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
- Contributions: What are the paper's main contributions?
- Clarity: Is the paper well written?

> This system has been modified to have more explicit titles. 
> 
> After reading the paper, you should be able to answer:
> - Type
> 	- Methodology – Introduces a new method, algorithm, or approach to address a specific problem. It explains the theoretical basis, design, and often includes experiments or examples to demonstrate effectiveness.
> 	- Empirical – Presents experiments or observations to test hypotheses or explore phenomena. This type often includes detailed data analysis.
> 	- Application – Demonstrates how a specific method, model, or tool can be applied to solve real-world problems.
> 	- Benchmarking – Compares the performance of various methods, tools, or algorithms on specific tasks or datasets.
> 	- Review – Summarizes and synthesizes the current state of research on a particular topic. It provides an overview of key studies, findings, and trends, helping to identify gaps in knowledge or future research directions.
> 	- Survey – Similar to a review paper but often more comprehensive, providing an extensive summary of research in a specific area, categorizing different approaches, and sometimes comparing them systematically.
> - Theoretical Framework
> - Assumptions
> - Contributions
> - Writing and Presentation Quality

Next, you can decide whether to do any more passes. You may choose to not read further because:
- the paper does not interest you,
- you don't know enough about the area to understand the paper, or
- the authors make invalid assumptions.

IMPORTANT: Most reviewers will make only one pass over a paper. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reviewer cannot understand the highlights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

## The Second Pass

- The second pass is for you to grasp the content, but not the details.
- This pass should take up to an hour.
- This level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested, but does not rely in you research specialty.

Actions
- You will read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs.
- As you read, jot down the key points, or make comments in the margins.
- Look carefully at the figures, diagrams, and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes labelled properly? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant?
- Mark relevant unread references for further reading.

After
- You should be able to grasp the content of the paper. 
- You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else.

Note: Sometimes you won’t understand a paper even at the end of the second pass. This may be because the subject matter is new to you, with unfamiliar terminology and acronyms. Or the authors may use a proof or experimental technique that you don’t understand, so that the bulk of the pa- per is incomprehensible. The paper may be poorly written with unsubstantiated assertions and numerous forward references. Or it could just be that it’s late at night and you’re tired. 

You may now choose to:
- Set the paper aside, hoping you don’t need to understand the material to be successful in your career.
- Return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material.
- Persevere and go on to the third pass.

## The Third Pass

- The third pass is for you to understand the paper in depth.
- This pass requires great attention to detail. 
- This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader.

Actions
- You will virtually re-implement the paper; that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, recreate the work.
- You will compare this re-creation with the actual paper to identify a paper’s innovations, as well as its hidden failings and assumptions.
- You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
- You should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea.
- The comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools.
- You should jot down ideas for future work.

After
- You should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory.
- You should be able to identify its strong and weak points. 
- You should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.

# Doing a Literature Survey

1. Use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent papers in the area. Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections. You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, and perhaps, if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper. If you can find such a survey, you are done. Read the survey, congratulating yourself on your good luck.
2. Otherwise, in the second step, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These are the key papers and researchers in that area. Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they’ve published recently. That will help you identify the top conferences in that field because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences.
3. The third step is to go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey. Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.
