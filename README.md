This repository contains:
1. An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault for recording research notes using the [Zettelkasten note-taking method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOSZOCoqOo8&ab_channel=ShuOmi).
2. Excel spreadsheet templates for monitoring PhD productivity, including annual PhD goals and weekly PhD tasks.

## Obsidian Valut

The Obsidian valut includes sample literature notes and sample permanent notes, as well as templates for these note types. You can find descriptions of each element of the templates within the `__Templates/__Template Descriptions` folder. You can change the color of the callout boxes using Obisidan's instructions to [customize callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts).

### Annual PhD Goals Template

![Annual PhD Goals Template](https://github.com/sheilaschoepp/productivity/blob/main/images/Annual%20PhD%20Goals.png?raw=true)

#### Instructions
1. Goal: Clearly describe each goal so you know exactly what you're aiming for.
2. Priority: Assign a priority level to each goal (e.g., high, medium, low) to help you focus on what's most important.
3. Start: The date you plan to start working on the goal.
4. End: The deadline for achieving the goal.
5. Status: The current state of each goal (e.g., not started, in progress, completed, on hold).
6. Progress: Track your progress toward each goal (i.e., percentage completed).
7. Deliverables: List the main outputs or results you expect from each goal, such as completing a research paper, presenting at a conference, or obtaining a grant. These deliverables should be tangible and measurable, which will make it easier to assess your progress.
8. Impact: Describe the potential benefits or impact of achieving each goal on your PhD journey. This could be related to advancing your research, building your professional network, developing new skills, or improving your work-life balance.
9. Notes: Any additional information, reminders, or comments related to the goal.
10. Review Dates: Schedule periodic review dates to evaluate your progress and make any necessary adjustments.
11. Custom: You may wish to include a custom column.
12. Custom: You may wish to include a custom column.

#### Special Features

1. If a goal start date has passed, but the project status is blank or is "Not Started", the cell will be highlighted in red to indicate an important date has passed.  Change the start date or the project status to "In Progress" to remove the highlighting.
2. If a goal end date has passed, but the project status is not "Completed", the cell will be highlighted in red to indicate an important date has passed.  Change the end date or the project status to "Completed" to remove the highlighting.
3. If a goal review date has passed and the review is not marked as done (i.e., with a "Y"), the cell will be highlighted in red to indicate that the review date has passed.  Change the review date or mark the review as done to remove the highlighting.

### Weekly PhD Tasks Template

![Weekly PhD Tasks Template](https://github.com/sheilaschoepp/productivity/blob/main/images/Weekly%20PhD%20Tasks.png?raw=true)

#### Instructions

1. Task: Clearly describe each task you need to complete.
2. Priority: Assign a priority level to each task (e.g., high, medium, low) to help you focus on what's most important.
3. Estimated Time (h): Estimate how long you think each task will take to complete.
4. Actual Tine (h): Track how long each task actually took to complete.
5. Status: The current state of each task (e.g., not started, in progress, completed, on hold).
6. Progress: Track your progress toward each task (i.e., percentage completed).
7. Deliverables: List the main outputs or results you expect from each task. These deliverables should be tangible and measurable, which will make it easier to assess your progress.
8. Impact: Describe the potential benefits or impact of achieving each task.
9. Notes: Any additional information, reminders, or comments related to the task.
10. Custom: You may wish to include a custom column.
11. Custom: You may wish to include a custom column.

#### Special Features

1. When you enter an estimated time for a task, a data bar will appear.  This data bar indicates the portion of the week's total estimated time that you will need to dedicate to the task.
2. When you enter an actual time, a data bar will appear.  This data bar indicates the portion of the week's total actual time that you dedicated to the task.
